\lettrine[lines=3, findent=3pt, nindent=0pt]{G}{lobal} village was the term coined in the 1960s by the Canadian thinker H. Marshall McLuhan \cite{mcluhan1962} to describe the society after the birth of mass media: all parts of the World were brought together by the communication abilities given by technological advancement. \\
In the past year this concept has been amplified by the COVID-19 situation going on: it is just thanks to Internet connected devices that \textit{smart working}, learning or simply chatting with friend and family, is possible. \\
Unfortunately this heavily relying on technology lead to a substantial raise of cyber-crimes in the period December 2019 - June 2020, with a consequent economic damage \cite{SAJIM1277}. Home-based work increases exposure to cyber-risks because individuals connect through less-reliable and unsecured Internet connections. Employees working from remote locations can access corporate networks using personal devices.
