\lettrine[lines=3, findent=3pt, nindent=0pt]{G}{lobal} village was the term coined in the 1960s by the Canadian thinker H. Marshall McLuhan \cite{mcluhan1962} to describe the society after the birth of mass media: all parts of the World were brought together by the communication abilities given by technological advancement. \\
Nowadays, with broad adoption of digital technologies, mass-communication represents the foundation of modern society, leading to concerns about privacy and security.

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem}

The evolution of cyber-attack techniques, becoming more sophisticated than ever, poses a critical challenge in accurately and reliably detecting intrusions.\\ The first \gls{ids} was proposed in 1980 \cite{Andreson1980} and since then the industry has arisen, but modern \glsxtrshortpl{ids} aren't still perfect and suffer mainly from two problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\faCaretRight] \textit{False-alarm rate}: generating too many alerts for nonthreatening situations raises the burden for security analysts, and can cause harmful attacks to be ignored. To build an effective and reliable \gls{ids}, it is mandatory to consider the \textit{detection rate} \cite{Liu2019};
    \item[\faCaretRight] \textit{Unknown attack detection}: attack variants and novel attacks emerge constantly and more and more frequently, hence the need of being able to detect unknown attacks. Some \glsplural{ids} rely on the signatures of known attacks and cannot identify new threats \cite{Hodo2017}.
\end{itemize}
Researchers in this filed aim at high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate. \\
If provided with sufficient training data, machine learning algorithms can detect both attack variants and novel ones \cite{Hodo2017}. Another perk brought by machine learning models is that they do not rely heavily on domain knowledge, and so have a more lightweight design \cite{Khraisat2019}. \\ With that in mind, in order to achieve well grounded results, it is necessary to know which network features represent which attack \cite{Iglesias2015} and what data is sustainable for detecting certain types of attacks. Furthermore a comprehensive analysis of machine learning algorithms is needed for identifying the most suitable one for the implementation \cite{Liu2019}, alongside the dataset needed for its training \cite{Sharafaldin2019}.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

In order to solve the problems displayed above, it will be used machine learning to improve the accuracy of threats-detection, with flexible and dynamic monitoring of the network. This project can be broken into the following milestones:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a network monitor capable of saving traffic data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\faCaretRight] Set up a virtualized environment for testing purposes, but still realistic;
        \item[\faCaretRight] Choose a \gls{sdn} Controller on which running, as application, a monitoring software to gather data about network traffic
        \item[\faCaretRight] Store the information collected;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Create a metering and analysis system that can classify, through machine learning, the data previously acquired:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\faCaretRight] Choose a machine learning algorithm suitable for this use;
        \item[\faCaretRight] Perform machine learning classification of the above extracted traffic to detect threats to the security;
        \item[\faCaretRight] Evaluate the performance of the \gls{ids} using an appropriate dataset.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
