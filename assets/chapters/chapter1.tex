\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

\lettrine[lines=4, findent=3pt, nindent=0pt]{G}{lobal} village was the term coined in the 1960s by the Canadian thinker H. Marshall McLuhan \cite{mcluhan1962} to describe the society after the birth of mass media: all parts of the World were brought together by the communication abilities given by technological advancement. \\
Nowadays, with broad adoption of digital technologies, mass-communication represents the foundation of modern society, leading to concerns about privacy and security.

\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem}

The evolution of cyber-attack techniques, becoming more sophisticated than ever, poses a critical challenge in accurately and reliably detecting intrusions.\\ The first \gls{ids} was proposed in 1980 \cite{Andreson1980} and since then the industry has arisen, but modern \glsxtrshortpl{ids} aren't still perfect and suffer mainly from two problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemAR \textit{False-alarm rate}: generating too many alerts for nonthreatening situations raises the burden for security analysts, and can cause harmful attacks to be ignored. To build an effective and reliable \gls{ids}, it is mandatory to consider the \textit{detection rate} \cite{Axelsson2000} and \cite{Liu2019};
    \itemAR \textit{Unknown attack detection}: attack variants and novel attacks are created constantly and more and more frequently, hence the need of being able to detect unknown attacks. Some \glsplural{ids} rely on the signatures of known attacks and cannot identify new threats \cite{Hodo2017}.
\end{itemize}
Researchers in this filed aim at an high detection accuracy, with a low false alarm rate. \\
If provided with sufficient training data, \gls{ml} algorithms can detect both attack variants and novel ones. Another perk brought by \gls{ml} models is that they do not rely heavily on domain knowledge, resulting in a more lightweight design \cite{Khraisat2019}. 
\par With that in mind, in order to achieve well grounded results, it is necessary to know which network features represent which attack \cite{Iglesias2015} and what data is sustainable for detecting certain types of threats. Furthermore a comparison between machine learning algorithms is needed to identify the most suitable one for this purpose, alongside the dataset needed for its training \cite{Sharafaldin2019}.

\section{Previous Work}
\label{sec:prev-work}

The application of \gls{ml} to \glsplural{ids} is becoming more and more frequent. Several papers deals with the subject, using different algorithms, datasets and methodologies. A good overview of previous works regarding algorithms and methodologies can be found in \textit{Shallow and Deep Networks Intrusion Detection Systems} \cite{Hodo2017}, \textit{Analysis of Network Features for Anomaly Detection} \cite{Iglesias2015} and \textit{Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods for Intrusion Detection Systems} \cite{Liu2019}.
\par A fundamental paper concerning the datasets used for the \gls{ml} model training is \textit{Toward Generating a New Intrusion Detection Dataset and Intrusion Traffic Characterization} \cite{icissp17}, in which the \textit{CICIDS2017} dataset is presented (discussed in section \ref{subsec:datasets-for-evaluation} and used chapter \ref{chap:methodology}).

\section{Challenges}
\label{sec:objectives}

\gls{ml} will be used, to improve accuracy and flexibility of an \glsfirst{ids}, in combination with a network monitor. This project can be broken into the following milestones:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a network monitor capable of saving traffic data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemAR Set up a virtualized environment for testing purposes;
        \itemAR Choose a \gls{sdn} Controller to interface with the monitoring software for gathering information about network traffic;
        \itemAR Store the data collected;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Create a metering and analysis system that can classify, through \gls{ml}, the data previously acquired:
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemAR Choose a \gls{ml} algorithm suitable for this use and train it;
        \itemAR Perform \gls{ml} classification of the above extracted traffic to detect threats to the security;
        \itemAR Evaluate the performance of the \gls{ids} using an appropriate dataset.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

% DELIMITATION
%----------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Delimitation}
\label{subsec:delimitation}

This study is limited to the detection of the attacks included in \textit{CICIDS2017}, using supervised learning methodologies. Moreover, the scope of this work is to understand how to \textit{detect} malicious activity on a network in an efficient and reliable way; \textit{preventing} it exceeds the objectives of the dissertation and won't be covered.
\par Lastly, the \glsxtrshort{gui} was implemented to create a \gls{poc} of what could be a final, commercial product and so lacks more advanced features, not useful for the purpose.

\section{Project Description}
\label{sec:proj-description}

The central premise of this work is to implement a \gls{nids} which relies on \gls{ml} to provide accurate classification, maintaining a lightweight architecture.
\par In chapter \ref{chap:state-of-the-art} the background theory is provided, along with the choice of tools, the overall requirements and the adopted methodology. Starting from the basics, regarding how a network works (\ref{sec:network-traffic}), the focus is shifted to traffic duplication in order to understand how to effectively acquire what to analyze (\ref{subsec:network-monitoring}). It is then considered how to characterize what was just gathered (\ref{subsec:traffic-characterization}). Lastly, an overview of \glsplural{ids}' taxonomy (\ref{subsec:taxonomy-ids}) is presented to understand how to integrate the system into the environment, along with a discussion regarding \gls{ml} approaches (\ref{sec:machine-learning}).
\par In chapter \ref{chap:methodology} the details with respect to the development of the \gls{ids} are discussed, taking into account what was disclosed in previous works. This chapter is split into four different sections: the first one deals with the concept adopted in the development stage (\ref{sec:concept}), followed by an explanation of the \gls{ml} model trained (\ref{sec:model-training}), and by a description of the network monitor implementation (\ref{sec:monitor-implementation}). A \gls{poc} showing the capabilities of the \gls{ids} (\ref{sec:poc}) is presented at the end of the chapter. 
\par The results of the dissertation are then presented in chapter \ref{chap:results}, accompanied by charts and tables, and reviewed in chapter \ref{chap:conclusions}.
